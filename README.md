# Java-Numbered_RightAngleTriangle
This Java program generates a numbered right-angle triangle pattern based on user input. It prompts the user to enter a number, which determines the number of rows in the triangle. Each row contains the same digit repeated, incrementing from 1 to n. The nested loops handle row and column iteration, printing the pattern.
